      <p>Sauté the onions:</p>
      <p>
        Heat butter in a large skillet (preferably cast iron) on medium heat.
        Add the onion and cook a few minutes, until translucent.

      <p>Add the potatoes and corned beef:</p>
      <p>
        Mix in the chopped corned beef and potatoes. Spread out evenly over the
        pan. Increase the heat to high or medium high and press down on the
        mixture with a metal spatula.

      <p>Corned Beef Hash Pressed Down into the Skillet Using a Spatula</p>
      <p>Cook until browned and then flip:</p>
      <p>
        Do not stir the potatoes and corned beef, but let them brown. If you
        hear them sizzling, this is good.
      </p>
      <p>
        Use a metal spatula to peek underneath and see if they are browning. If
        nicely browned, use the spatula to flip sections over in the pan so that
        they brown on the other side. Press down again with the spatula.
      </p>
      <p>
        If there is too much sticking, you can add a little more butter to the
        pan. Continue to cook in this manner until the potatoes and the corned
        beef are nicely browned.

        black pepper, and add salt to taste.
      </p>
      <p>Serve with fried or poached eggs for breakfast.</p>
