      <p>Cook the beef:</p>
      <p>
        In a large bowl, season the beef pieces with 1 tablespoon of the salt.
        Heat the olive oil in a large (6 to 8 quart), thick-bottomed pot over
        high heat.
      </p>
      <p>
        Add the beef all at once and cook, stirring occasionally, until the meat
        is no longer pink and some liquid has accumulated at the bottom of the
        pot, about 10 minutes.

      <p>Add the vegetables:</p>
      <p>
        Add the celery, onion, carrots, and parsnips. Reduce heat to
        medium-high. Season with remaining teaspoon of salt and 1/2 teaspoon
        pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until most of the liquid has
        evaporated and vegetables are slightly softened, about 10 minutes more.
      </p>
      <p>
        Add the thyme and flour, stir, and cook until raw flour is no longer
        visible, about 30 seconds.
      </p>
      <p>Add the broth and simmer:</p>
      <p>
        Add the beef broth, water, balsamic vinegar, and Worcestershire sauce.
        Bring mixture to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low and cook,
        partially covered and stirring every 20 minutes or so, until stew has
        darkened and thickened slightly, about 1 hour.
      </p>
      <p>Add the potatoes and finish:</p>
      <p>
        Add potatoes to the stew, stir well, and continue to simmer until the
        potatoes and beef are tender, about 30 minutes. Season to taste,
        transfer to serving bowls, sprinkle with parsley, and serve.
